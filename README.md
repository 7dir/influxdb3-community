Unlocked Community Builds for InfluxDB 3.x IOx _(eye-ox)_ aka _InfluxDB3-Core_

### Motivation
üòÑ Provide community access to low-cost storage, unlimited cardinality and flightsql<br>
ü•µ‚Äç Unlocking _"Open Core"_ limitations only designed to promote Cloud/Enterprise<br>

üî• This builder is based on the unlocked "InfluxDB3-Core" fork: https://github.com/refluxdb/refluxdb<br>

#### Nightly Builds
- [x] [docker](https://github.com/metrico/influxdb3-community/pkgs/container/influxdb3-unlocked): `docker pull ghcr.io/refluxdb/refluxdb:latest`
- [x] [binary](https://github.com/metrico/influxdb3-community/releases): `github.com/refluxdb/influxdb3-community/releases/latest/download/influxdb3`

<br>

## Get Started

üëâ For a full liste of unlocked features refer to the [RefluxDB](https://github.com/refluxdb/refluxdb) README

This guide uses Docker and docker-compose. You can run locally using a [static build](https://github.com/metrico/influxdb3-community/releases).

#### Static
```bash
curl -fsSL github.com/metrico/influxdb3-community/releases/latest/download/influxdb3 -O \
&& chmod +x influxdb3
```

#### Docker

The default compose uses local filesystem. Use the full recipe for Object Storage and Postgres Catalog.

```
docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yml -d
```

Your local IOx endpoint should be ready on port `8086`

#### Health

Check the instance health: 
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8086/health
```
